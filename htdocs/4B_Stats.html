                    Meanwhile, here are the number of worldwide vaccinations
                    (these are separated by number of shots).

                <p>
                    If you can't notice, the number of those who are fully vaccinated
                    are catching up for those with al least 1 dose, meaning that fewer
                    new people are getting vaccinated.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Also it seems that only a small percantage of people worldwide have
                    received a booster shot.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Now here is the number of vaccines administered by country, per 100 people.

                    For the final, here is the impact of COVID to our global economy.
