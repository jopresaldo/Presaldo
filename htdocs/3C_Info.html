                <h1> The Sickness </h1>
                <p>
                    The SARS-CoV-2 virus is the reason for the illnes called COVID-19.
                    COVID-19 is a sickness that has similar symptoms to another known sickness,
                    influenza (or the flu), but both diseases are cuased byb different viruses.
                </p>

                <p>
                    First thing to note are the symptoms of COVID-19. The range of the symptoms
                    ranges from mild to severe illnesses. Symptoms of COVID-19 include:

                    <ul>Fever or chills</ul>
                    <ul>Cough</ul>
                    <ul>Shortness of Breath and Difficulty Breathing</ul>
                    <ul>Fatigue</ul>
                    <ul>Muscle or body aches</ul>
                    <ul>Headache</ul>
                    <ul>Sore Throat</ul>
                    <ul>Runny or congested nose</ul>
                    <ul>Nausea</ul>
                    <ul>Diarrhea</ul>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Once it enters your body, the virus then attacks your respiratory tract.
                    This includes your mouth, nose, throat, and lungs. Your lower airways have
                    more ACE2 receptors, which is where the virus will go, and will attack there
                    deeper than common cold viruses. 
                </p>

                <h1> The Variants </h1>
                <p>
                    Like all viruses, the SARS-CoV-2 virus also mutates. A mutation is when the genetic
                    code is suddenly altered. Think of it as when you copy paste something and it
                    came out all wrong. That's a mutation. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    A mutation can either strengthen or weakenn a species, which depends on which strand
                    of genes have been altered. These are the most known mutations of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

                    <ul>Alpha</ul>
                    <ul>Beta</ul>
                    <ul>Gamma</ul>
                    <ul>Delta</ul>
                    <ul>Omicron</ul>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Delta and Omicron are the most well known here, and are currently the most dominant
                    variant in the world. While Delta spreads fast, Omicron is faster.
