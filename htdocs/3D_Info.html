                    Since 2021, vaccines have ben developed to help stop the spread
                    of COVID-19. Many type sof these vaccines havee developed such as Pfizer,
                    J&J, Astrazeneca, Covax, Sinovax, etc.

                    Vaccines an effective way to combat a virus. In shorter terms, a vaccine basically
                    tricks your immune system to develop antibodies against a virus by injecting "dead" 
                    counterparts of said virus into your body. SInce it is dead, it does not give you 
                    the illness.
                </p>

                <p>
                    What amkes the COVID-19 vaccine different, however, is that it uses a new tool
                    called an mRNA vaccine. This vaccine sends out RNA coding to our cells to develop spike proteins
                    that are present in the virus. This triggers our immune system to fight against it.
