                <h1> The Virus Itself</h1>
                <p>
                    This virus is also known as SARS-Cov-2, which stands for
                    "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome", a viral respiratory
                    illness caused by a coronavirus.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Yes, there is not only 1 coronavirus. Coronavirus is a 
                    family of viruses that cause respiratory problems in humans
                    AND animals. Most cases are mild but with the emergence of
                    SARS (China, 2002 - 2003) and MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, 2012)
                    they can also cause severe disease.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Coronaviruses have relatively simple structures. They are spherical
                    and coated with spikes of protein to bind with healthy cells and infect them.

                    These spikes, under the vision of a powerful microscope, give the coronavirus
                    their name, as they make a crown (which is "corona" in Latin).
                </p>

                <p>
                    This particular coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, is believed to come from bats
                    and was transmitted to humans in the end of 2019. It is still not sure
                    whether the transmission was direct, or it was transmitted fmo other animals
                    before landing in humans.
