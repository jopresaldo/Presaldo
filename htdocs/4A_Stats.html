                    As you can see, the numbers spiked just 2 months ago, December 2021, and is still high.
                    We also currently have 5.7 million deaths due to COVID. Here is the distribution per day.

                    As of recently. Europe seems to be the frontrunner of the COVID 
                    cases, although the Americas rare not too far behind. During the past 2 year 
                    reign of the virus, it seems that cases have spiked everywhere since just 2 
                    months ago - late December.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This means that the virus is still effectively spreading, and precautions still
                    need to be taken.
