                <h1> Transmission </h1>
                <p>
                    Accoriding to the WHO website (2020), there are 3 main ways to
                    transmit the virus.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <ol> Contact and droplet transmission
                         - Transmission this way occur through "direct, indirect, 
                         or close contact with infected people through infected secretions
                         such as saliva and respiratory secretions." This means that a person
                         can be infected via someone who has been infected with the virus sneezes,
                         coughs, talks, or sings.
                    </ol>

                    <ol>
                         Airborne
                         - Airborne transmission is defined as the "spread of infectious agent
                         caused by the dissemination of droplet nuclei (aerosols) that remain
                         infectious" even when suspended in the air for a long time.
                    </ol>

                    <ol>
                        Fomite Transmission
                        -  These droplets can also stick to surfaces and stay there, which is
                        what fomite means (contaminated surfacees). A viable SARS-CoV-2 virus
                        can be found on surfaces for "periods ranging from hours to days,
                        depending on the ambient environment."
                    </ol>
