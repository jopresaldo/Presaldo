                <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has been looming over the world for 2 years (and counting). Now with the development of life-saving vaccines, government try their hardest to get people inoculated.</p>
                <p>but not everybody is convinced, and some people are against the beliefs and findings of scientists and spread misinformation about these vaccines, and even about the pandemic itself.</p>
                <p>This purpose of the website is to help combat the misinformation and spread well-supported facts about COVID-19 and its vaccines.</p>
                <p>A questionnaire may be answered to give the more important information first to the user, but the user may not proceed with answering and just look at the numbers involving the pandemic.</p>
                <p>Happy reading, and STAY SAFE!</p>
